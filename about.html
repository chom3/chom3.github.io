<h2>About Me</h2>

<span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/fbpro.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span>
Hi, my name is Corey Hom. I graduated from Binghamton University in 2016 with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and joined Deutsche Bank's graduate class of 2016. From there I went on to work in two rotations and permanently joined my second rotation as a fulltime software developer.

  Some of my hobbies lately have been designing and developing some side projects to make daily life easier. I'm passionate about fitness and working out, and I try to keep competitive with esports such as Super Smash Brothers Melee as well as following the Mets in baseball!
