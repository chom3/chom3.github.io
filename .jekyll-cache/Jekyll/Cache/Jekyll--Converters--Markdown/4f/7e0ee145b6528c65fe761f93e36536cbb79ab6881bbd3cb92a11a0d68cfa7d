<p>Return the index of the first occurrence of a substring in a string.</p>

<p>If the length of the string is 0 return 0.</p>

<p>If there is no match return -1.</p>

<p>String manipulation questions are asked often in interview processes. I think these are necessary to be prepared especially if strings are a weakpoint.</p>

<p>Another note is that I solved this my way, looks ike itâ€™s O(1) space and O(N) (iterates as long as the given string) time. It could be cleaned up and optimized more.</p>

<p>In a given interview, as long as you can explain your thought process as you write your code I believe it will be good enough.</p>

<h1 id="the-thought-process">The Thought Process</h1>
<p>An easy way would be to start iterating through the string and if you hit a possible match for the substring, start iterating through the substring.</p>

<p>Then we can start setting some flags.</p>

<p>Once we start iterating, we need to see if thereâ€™s a possible start to an answerâ€¦ We can set this by using a boolean flag.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Given: string s, string sub

//Start
int i = 0;
int j = 0;
int possibleAnswer = -1;
boolean firstOccurrence = true;

//iterate through the string
while( i &lt; s.length()){
}

//how to figure out there's a possible start
if (s.charAt(i) == sub.charAt(j)){
    possibleAnswer = i; //possible index
}

We can use a flag here to set to false so we won't overwrite our possibleAnswer flag

if (firstOccurrence){
    possibleAnswer = i;
    firstOccurrence = false;
}

Iterate through both the string and substring:
i++;
j++;


What happens if we don't match:
We need to just move forward with i

i++;

But what if our j was already moving forward? We need to reset that. 

Also consider if we went past the answer while iterating through our i/j's - so we'll need to reset back to where we were as well. We saved our place with possibleAnswer! So we can increment 1 past that.

And we need to reset our flag.

if (j &gt; 0){
    j = 0;
    i = possibleAnswer + 1;
    firstOccurrence = true;
}

In the end - if j is equal to the length of the substring then we made it to the end and can just return possibleAnswer.

If we did not, we return -1.
