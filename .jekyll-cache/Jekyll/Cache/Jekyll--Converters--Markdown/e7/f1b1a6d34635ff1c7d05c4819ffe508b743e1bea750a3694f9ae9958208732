<h3 id="about-you">About You:</h3>

<p>You want to make a change but you just don’t know where to start.</p>

<p>The key is that you want to change. I can’t force you, but I can offer some advice and help.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I want to assume you’re healthy enough to go to the gym and don’t have any lingering health issues. Rehab should have a different approach!</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me:</h3>

<p>I started working out in my freshman year of college and I didn’t know what I was doing. My friends helped me start at our university gym and I took an interest in just turning my life around.</p>

<p>In the summer of rising into my senior year, I decided I want to gain and lose weight at the same time, it didn’t work as well as I had hoped and progress was slowed.
In my senior year I injured myself and had to work around these injuries.</p>

<p>In my first year out of college, I made huge progress in figuring out my fitness goals and achieving smaller sub-goals.</p>

<p>Currently I’m working on some other goals of mine but fitness has played a large role in keeping myself consistent and accountable</p>

<p>Maxes (173 lb bodyweight)</p>

<p>240 Bench</p>

<p>315 Squat</p>

<p>405 Deadlift</p>

<p>150 OHP</p>

<h2 id="i-introduction">I. Introduction</h2>

<p>An open mind is huge for growth. Ask for criticism. Ask for feedback. Remember that criticism and feedback from a person you respect is not an attack on your character. Use it for improvement.</p>

<p>Why is fitness the focus of this guide? I think consistently working out teaches you a certain level of discipline that can carry over to your mentality outside of the gym. Forming healthy habits and daily schedules helps simplify so you can focus on the complexities in your life.</p>

<p><strong>“I gotta get my shit together”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“Yeah I have to start working out”</strong></p>

<p><strong>“I don’t have the time”</strong></p>

<p>I think we’ve all been guilty of saying these words.</p>

<p>My thoughts:</p>

<p>“Gotta” / “have to” are close to the solution. Acknowledging the problem is key, you just need to act on it.</p>

<p>“I don’t have the time” just means “this new thing isn’t a higher priority over the other tasks in my life”. If you get to this point, I ask you - what are your priorities?</p>

<p>This guide is intended to give a basic understanding on adding fitness into your lifestyle as well as giving you the tools to do more research. These are pointers to be used to help you not feel overwhelmed by everything you read online as well as dispelling some common broscience myths that people exaggerate.</p>

<p>Your results reflect your effort.</p>

<p>My personal recommendation is to learn to go to the gym by yourself. Having a workout buddy is fun but then you lose focus or you depend on your buddy to go to the gym with you. Learn to work out on your own, create your own game plan at the gym, and then you can take a buddy along.</p>

<p>Remember that people go to the gym for self improvement. Working out is the most selfish thing that you can do and no one CARES. You’re working out to make yourself better than you were yesterday. You’re not working out as a favor to somebody or to impress somebody. What happens if that “favor” is done? Then you stop? You should be improving yourself for YOU.</p>

<h2 id="ii-determining-your-goals-and-common-sayings">II. Determining your goals and common sayings</h2>

<p><strong>I wanna look “tone” and “lean” and you don’t “wanna get too big”.</strong></p>

<p>You won’t because these big bodybuilders spent their entire lives getting to where they are now. You, a beginner, will need to work out consistently with optimal nutrition and training to even approach this point. So I wouldn’t worry about it.</p>

<p>What I’ve heard:</p>

<p>“I don’t have time to workout :(“ - You do. You just don’t want to make time. You can work it in.</p>

<p>If you don’t want to or try, I really can’t help you.</p>

<p>“I don’t workout my legs cause I need my legs to walk the next day ha ha ha” - You don’t have to, do whatever you want, I’m just here to tell you it’s important to be fit. You’ll figure it out later.</p>

<p>“I heard I can do high volume light weight and i’ll look like <strong>__</strong>!!” -</p>

<p>There’s some truth to this, but that doesn’t mean do 1,000 sets of 1 lb. There’s a balance to these things. When high volume is 10 sets of 60% of your max, it’s still somewhat heavy compared to the previous work.</p>

<p>“I don’t really want to be a powerlifter and lift heavy weights…” - so you WANT to be weak?</p>

<p>Bodybuilders lift heavy. Powerlifters lift heavy.</p>

<p>I’ll tell you Arnold can bench more than 95 lbs.</p>

<p>Lifting heavy tears the muscle cells and your muscles respond by rebuilding into bigger muscles.</p>

<p>Lifting a lot of volume releases hormones that make your muscles grow bigger too.</p>

<p>These two go hand in hand.</p>

<p>No one starts skinny and squats 500 lbs. You have to eat. You have to build muscle. You have to be in the gym consistently.</p>

<p><strong>Starting points for goals:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m overweight and want to lose weight - but I don’t really care about muscle building.</p>

    <p>This is fair and valid! Watch what you eat, do some cardio, swim, bike, jog (if your knees can handle it). Eat at a deficit and you’ll surely lose weight. Weight is done in the kitchen and the gym just helps supplement your cardiovascular health.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m overweight and want to replace it with muscle.</p>

    <p>This was me! You can abuse the fact that you’re heavier and able to lift more weight than someone starting out at skinnier weight can. Eat right and work hard.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m underweight and want to gain muscle.</p>

    <p>Eat more. Go to the gym and workout.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’m underweight and want to stay underweight</p>

    <p>Why r u here</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Woah woah wait, I’m a girl…</p>

    <p>You’re a girl, so you don’t have fitness goals? Progress and starting weight may be different, but you’re no different from anyone else. Gains don’t discriminate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanna do crossfit</p>

    <p>Not my thing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Olympic lifting?</p>

    <p>Also not my thing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I wanna work on <em>insert sport here</em></p>

    <p>These take different types of workouts.</p>

    <p>Wanna jump higher for basketball? Maybe do some box jumps.</p>

    <p>Wanna be a better swimmer? Swim more, do other swimming related workouts.</p>

    <p>Wanna be a better runner? You’re gonna have to run more.</p>

    <p>Point is that you should do your research for the field of interest that you want to work on.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="iii-forming-your-program">III. Forming Your Program</h2>

<p>A huge learning source for me is just Google. Reddit. Youtube. They have a ton of good beginner programs for working out and I think these are key to starting out.</p>

<p><em>*What should the program have?</em> What should I be looking for?*</p>

<p>An obvious progression scheme.</p>

<p>Decent volume.</p>

<p>A good spread of hitting muscle groups.</p>

<p>Looks like it will accomplish your goals.</p>

<h2 id="iv-nutrition">IV. Nutrition</h2>

<p>If you’re skinny, you need to eat smart.</p>

<p>If you want to put on muscle, you need to eat smart.</p>

<p>If you’re obese and want to lift more, you need to eat smart.</p>

<p>Eat protein, eat carbs, stay within your calories if you’re counting. Learn serving sizes. One serving size of pasta is A LOT smaller than you think.</p>

<p>Eat your vegetables.</p>

<p>Make sure you eat SMART. Get your nutrients. Eat food in moderation. It’s the holidays and you want to feast? It’s okay. Don’t fall off the wagon and mess up all your progress though. Stay consistent, eat smart, treat yourself, and your body will thank you.</p>

<p>Fitness and health is a lifestyle, you can’t hit your goal and then just give up and binge eat. Well, you can, but.. why?</p>

<p>Eat your vegetables.</p>

<p>Those goals of yours? It’s a marathon to attain them. You might eventually set new goals. This whole thing is not a race, you’re can’t beat anyone at accomplishing your OWN goals.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>One serving size of cereal is A LOT smaller than you think.</p>

<p>If you don’t see results (weight gain/weight loss) after many weeks of eating, YOU ARE WRONG WITH YOUR FOOD ESTIMATES. Buy a kitchen scale, weigh your food, learn your daily caloric intake.</p>

<p>Also, don’t forget to drink enough water. Drink more if you’re bigger, and drink more if you’re exercising.</p>

<p>Stay hydrated.</p>

<p>Eat your vegetables.</p>

<p>Take care of your body and it will carve itself into a goddamn statue.</p>

<p>Wanna eat fast food everyday? Then you’ll look like a guy who eats fast food everyday. If you want to count your calories, buy a scale, use myfitnesspal or something and TRACK what you eat. It’s all for you. You ate a salad and now you can eat cheesecake? Sure, only you really have to know. Are you not seeing progress because of that? The results don’t lie.</p>

<p>Your results reflect your effort.</p>

<h2 id="v-working-out">V. Working Out</h2>

<p>MAKE SURE YOUR FORM IS GOOD.</p>

<p>Form can break down sometimes at heavy weights like a one rep max. It happens. That’s ok.</p>

<p>But form check. Practice your lifts. Take a video.</p>

<p>Hit proper depth on your squat.</p>

<p>Make sure you bench correctly by retracting your scapula.</p>

<p>Stay tight, don’t let your hips shoot up on deadlifts.</p>

<p><strong>DON’T BE AFRAID TO ASK.</strong></p>

<p>“Hey man, did I hit depth?”</p>

<p>“Hey man, can you spot me?”</p>

<p>“Hey can you check this vid of me deadlifting and tell me what you think?”</p>

<p>No one judges you at the gym for needing help. People would be glad to help you. Everyone starts from somewhere.</p>

<p>Sometimes you might come across conflicting information and that’s okay. Try to see what works for you. Be willing to experiment and fail. There’s no one size fits all way of doing things! You need to make it work for you.</p>

<h2 id="vi-equipment-and-supplements">VI. Equipment and Supplements</h2>

<p>Do I need a belt?</p>

<p>Do I need wrist straps?</p>

<p>Do I need wrist wraps?</p>

<p>Do I need knee sleeves?</p>

<p>Do I need preworkout?</p>

<p>Do I need protein powder?</p>

<p>What are BCAAS?!</p>

<p>There’s a ton of “do I need”. If you have the funds, yeah sure, get it. There’s sales, great brands to do your research on.</p>

<p>A belt can help you brace your core better, but make sure to get a good one. Those velcro ones are awful. Belts don’t protect you from injury, but they can teach you how to brace yourself properly or help keep you braced for that extra weight to lift.</p>

<p>Wrist straps help you lift more weight when your grip doesn’t allow you to, it helps.</p>

<p>Wrist wraps help support your wrists which support more weight.</p>

<p>Preworkout is that caffeine kick that helps you get pumped for the gym, sometimes you might need it, sometimes you don’t.</p>

<p>Protein powder is great for fitting in your diet, usually it’s very little calories for a bunch of protein. This is good for everyone since they’re trying to build more muscle!</p>

<p>BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids) are broken down proteins that give your muscles that extra energy source. Supplementing your diet with BCAAs may also help you recover from your workouts more quickly. They can help if you want it.</p>

<p>Conclusion here is that if you want it or think you need it and have the disposable income, get it. None of these are mandatory, but they can help.</p>

<h2 id="vii-results">VII. Results</h2>

<p>Don’t expect results to be immediate overnight. You did some ab workout, you think you’ll have a 6pack in the morning?</p>

<p>Changes take time, things slowly take shape.</p>

<p>“I’ve been doing this for a month and I don’t see a difference”</p>

<p>How long did you spend your life getting to where you are right now? Do you think a month of this changed life is going to undo all of that?</p>

<p>Fitness is a lifestyle. If you go consistently, you will see results. If you go 3 times a month you’ll never make progress at all.</p>

<p>“I go constantly and sometimes I have bad days..”
Happens. Think about why you had a bad day. Not enough sleep? Didn’t eat enough? Stressed out from something else? Help yourself have a good session the next time.</p>

<h3 id="vii-conclusion">VII. Conclusion</h3>

<p>Fitness is something that becomes a daily driver in your life.</p>

<p>Eat smart.</p>

<p>Eat your vegetables.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to ask for help.</p>

<p>Don’t be afraid to experiment and fail. Avoid paralysis analysis.</p>

<p>Be conscious of your form.</p>

<p>It’s a marathon, not a race.</p>
