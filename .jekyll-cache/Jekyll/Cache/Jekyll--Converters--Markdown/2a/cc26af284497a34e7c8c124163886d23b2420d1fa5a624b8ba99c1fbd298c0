<p>Given a node, remove it from the linked list.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
public class ListNode{
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x){
        val = x;
    }
}

1-&gt;2-&gt;3

Given node with value 2

Output:

1 -&gt; 3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Knowing this off the top of my head was huge for designing a least recently used cache. I was able to do a delete this node and create a new node to place at the top fairly easily by having this in mind.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a relatively simple question with a simple solution, so having the instant solution for this in your back pocket will help you not waste time during any interview questions.</p>

<h1 id="the-thought-process">The Thought Process</h1>
<p>You can be a little hacky and not totally delete, but replace this nodeâ€™s value with the next value, and skip over the next node.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ve effectively written over your current node with the next node and changed the pointer to next to the node after.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>public void deleteNode(ListNode node){
    node.val = node.next.val;
    node.next = node.next.next;
}
</code></pre></div></div>
